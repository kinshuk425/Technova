    <br>
    <p>
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines. 
        AI systems can perform tasks such as decision making, problem solving, pattern 
        recognition, and data analysis.

    <h2>Machine Learning (ML)</h2>
    <p>
        Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn from data. 
        Instead of being explicitly programmed, ML models find patterns and improve over time.
    </p>

    <h3>Types of Machine Learning</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Supervised Learning</strong> – Learning from labeled data.</li>
        <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning</strong> – Finding patterns in unlabeled data.</li>
        <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong> – Learning by trial and error.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Real-World AI Applications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Face Recognition (Phones, CCTV)</li>
        <li>Recommendation Systems (Netflix, YouTube)</li>
        <li>Chatbots & Virtual Assistants</li>
        <li>Medical Diagnosis</li>
        <li>Self-Driving Cars</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        AI has become a part of daily life and is transforming industries such as 
        healthcare, finance, retail, and cybersecurity.

    <h2>Neural Networks</h2>
    <p>
        Neural networks are inspired by the human brain. They consist of layers that 
        process information at different levels, enabling tasks like image recognition,
        language translation, and speech processing.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning play a crucial role in the future 
        of technology. Learning AI allows you to build smart systems that can learn, 
        adapt, and improve.
