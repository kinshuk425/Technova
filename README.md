## TechNova - Technical Blog Website
Hey! This is 'TechNova', my personal tech blog website project.
It's a clean and modern website where you can explore articles on **Web Development, AI & ML, and Cybersecurity**.
I built it using "HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript".

## Features:--
- Responsive and modern design  
- Navigation bar to switch between sections easily  
- Hero images and blog article images  
- Basic JavaScript functionality:  
  1. "Read Articles" button scrolls to the Blogs section  
  2. Contact form shows an alert and clears inputs after submit  
  3. Header color changes when page loads  
- Separate pages for individual articles  
- Styled tables in the Web Development page with colored borders  

## Future Improvements:--
- Add a dark mode toggle
- Add more interactive JS features
- Add more articles and images dynamically
- Improve table styles in all articles
